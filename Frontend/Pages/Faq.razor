                Nah mate, you can't smoke this. A FAQ is an acronym for <em>Frequently Asked Questions</em>.<br/>
                This particular FAQ is all about the Imagerecogniz-o-matic 2000 and how it works.

                <strike>As it is now, you can sadly only use files up to 512.000 bytes (give or take some overhead) - that's ,5MiB.</strike><br/>
                <strike>We're working on increasing the filesize tho, so this might change in the future.</strike><br/>
                Heureka! I have been upgraded to an int32, which means that it can be roughly 2GiB now :)

                As it is now I only officially support JPG/JPEG and PNG.<br/>
                However, <em>some</em> other file formats may work (I'm looking at you BMP), but I can't promise that you'll get a proper result from me.

                Long story short, it started as an assignment on my masters fifth semester, and the project started to grow on my master.<br/>
                It looked like a fun entry point into machine learning, that wasn't pure (and boring) CSV-files from an account manager ... now I'm just waiting for me to evolve into SkyNet :)

                Right now, I'm looking at 7 different objects. I model started out as an API for traffic cameras, hence the current limitation.
                <ul>
                    <li>Car</li>
                    <li>Bicycle</li>
                    <li>Moped</li>
                    <li>Motorbike</li>
                    <li>Truck</li>
                    <li>Bus</li>
                    <li>Person</li>
                </ul>
                I will probably add some more thingymadoos later on, and I could probably use your help for it!
